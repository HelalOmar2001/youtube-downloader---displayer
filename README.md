# YouTube Playlist Duration Calculator

This is a JavaScript project that calculates the total duration of a YouTube playlist by scraping the playlist page.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `script.js` file in a text editor.

2. Replace `'YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID'` in the `playlistUrl` variable with the ID of the YouTube playlist you want to calculate the duration for.

3. Save the changes.

4. Run the script:

   ```shell
   node script.js
   ```

   The script will fetch the playlist page, scrape the durations of each video, and calculate the total duration in seconds. The result will be printed to the console.
